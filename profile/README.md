# Sigma Security Storage
Storage for anything needed by Sigma Security. [Sigma Security GitHub](https://github.com/sigmasec)<br><br><br>

Why isn't everything on the SigmaSec organization? It is here because we want to ensure organization with our repositories on our main, and here we can just throw out random sloppy repos.
